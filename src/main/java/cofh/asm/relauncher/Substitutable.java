 * Ensure the named method has an identical signature (return type & parameters) to the annotated method. <br>
 * Ensure you do not switch on an enum inside the annotated method. JavaC implementation details means this will cause crashes.

 * Takes a class name as the value. e.g., "cofh.lib.network.ByteBufHelper"; requiring that class be available <br>
 * Can also substitute on modid using e.g., "mod:CoFHCore" as a value; requiring that mod be available <br>
 * Can also substitute on API using e.g., "api:CoFHAPI|energy" as a value; requiring that API be available <br>
 * Mod and API values can have a version range associated e.g., "mod:ThermalExpansion@[4.0.0, 4.1.0)"
